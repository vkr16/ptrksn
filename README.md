# Project Portfolio: PTRKSN

Welcome to my portfolio project repository! This is a work of mine that I've done on the PTRKSN project as a freelancer.

# Project Overview

PTRKSN stands for "Perencanaan Tata Ruang Kawasan Strategis Nasional" which means National Strategic Area Spatial Planning. This is a special division of the ministry of agrarian and spatial planning of the Republic of Indonesia. 

This project aims to create a web application that functions as an intermediary platform between ministries in carrying out joint activities including meeting agendas and exchanging documents related to certain activities.

The main idea of this application is a system that can record any joint agenda or activities carried out within the ministry and then the agenda or activity can be used as a platform for exchanging information including recording the results of meetings and exchanging other related documents. This application also provides a meeting attendance recording system related to certain activities.

In this project, I was responsible for creating the development plan and develop the web application using PHP programming language and CodeIgniter 4 as the main back-end programming stack and also using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Jquery and some other js library to build it's front-end.
